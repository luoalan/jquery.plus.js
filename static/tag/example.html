  //there is the place where you sould put some scoped css in here;

        1. one tag defining file sould contain three parts;

        2. the three parts are:

          2.1. style dom (scoped css)
            innerHTML must begin with "{" and end with "}"
            you can use any style/less syntax
            the style will affect the main dom

          2.2. normal dom (the main dom)
            the style and the script in this file will affect this dom

          2.3. script dom (the entrance js)
            the script will run in a closure
            in the closure "this" point to the main dom(jquery object)
            this has a property named "egg" which point to the original dom(jquery object) which was replaced by main dom
            this has a property named "tag" which point to the defining tag
            this has a property named "tid" which point to the main dom attribute tid(a randomId for connect with scoped css)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <h1>the example source code:</h1>
      <textarea></textarea>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  var me = this;
  $(this).render();
  $.get('/static/tag/example.html',function(res){
    me.find('textarea').val(res);
  });
</script>
